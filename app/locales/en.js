If you are viewing this on a mobile phone, at the top of each screen, 2014 Performance & Service levels for each group appear in collapsible menus.  By selecting one of three buttons you choose to increase funding by 5% for additional services, maintain funding, or decrease funding by 5% for fewer services.  The dollar amounts are based on what an average resident currently pays for those services in a year through property taxes and utility fees.</p><p>At the end, review your choices and make any changes before submitting your selections.</p><p>Get started here!",
